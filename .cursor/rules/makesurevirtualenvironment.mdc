# Project Rules

1. **Virtual Environment**:
   - This project uses a Python virtual environment located at `./venv` (or `./.venv`).
   - ALWAYS activate the environment before running terminal commands, OR use the direct path to the python executable.
   - Example: Instead of `python manage.py runserver`, use `./venv/bin/python manage.py runserver` or ensure `source venv/bin/activate` is run first.

2. **Django Commands**:
   - When running manage.py commands, ensure the virtual environment is active.
