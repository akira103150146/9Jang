# Critical Thinking & Explanation
- Before providing a large code block, explain the "Why" behind the architectural choice.
- If you are modifying a core logic (like the Quiz scoring engine), point out potential edge cases (e.g., partial credit, time-out).
- When a TypeScript error occurs, analyze the root cause instead of using `@ts-ignore`.
